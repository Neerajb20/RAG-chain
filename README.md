RAG-Chain: Retrieval-Augmented Generation System 🚀

📌 Project Overview

RAG-Chain is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by FAISS, LLaMA 3 (via Ollama), and Docker. This system enhances the response quality of LLMs by retrieving the most relevant text chunks from a knowledge base before generating structured answers.

🛠️ Features

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances LLM responses with real-world context.

FAISS for Vector Search: Efficiently stores and retrieves text embeddings.

LLaMA 3 (70B) via Ollama: Runs on a local Docker container.

Dockerized Deployment: Ensures a consistent runtime environment.

Custom Query Pipeline: Retrieves and structures answers from indexed text.
